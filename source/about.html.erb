<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm August Lilleaas. I <a href="http://kodemaker.no/august">work for Kodemaker</a> as a consultant. I live in Oslo, Norway, with my wife, a cat, and my daughter. I'm a self-taught programmer with a classical piano education from the Norwegian Academy of Music. I'm currently attending Algorithms and Datastructures on <a href="http://coursera.org">coursera.org</a>, to broaden my CS foundation.</p>

<p>I consider myself equally experienced in backend and frontend programming, and I've mostly worked with web apps, real-time systems and mobile apps. I used to do Ruby on Rails, but nowadays I'm more comfortable on the JVM, where I prefer to use Clojure. I have done a lot of Groovy (via the Grails framework), and try to use Java as little as possible. I consider myself a functional programmer, and I can talk about immutability for hours on end.</p>

<p>I blog about functional databases at <a href="http://dbs-are-fn.com">dbs-are-fn.com</a>, and I've used Datomic in a project. I wish I could use it more often.</p>

<p>I can be found on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/augustl">@augustl</a>, my e-mail is <a href="mailto:august@augustl.com">august@augustl.com</a>, and I have a <a href="http://github.com/augustl">Github account</a>. I hang out on irc.freenode.net as augustl.</p>

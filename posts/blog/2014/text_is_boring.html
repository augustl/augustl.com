title: Text is boring

<p>There's a bunch of new text editors around. Recently, Github announced <a href="http://atom.io/">Atom</a> which a lot of second guessing shitheads on the internet (myself included) has judged to oblivion for not being open source. <a href="http://www.lighttable.com/">Light table</a> is now open source, so yay. It's an IDE, but IDEs are just text editors with a toolbar of icons that would make Word 98 proud, and some clever features for auto completion built in. But they're still just text editors.</p>

<p>I like the "editor" part. But "text" bores me.</p>

<p>Optional semi colons bores me.</p>

<p>Newline before brackets bores me.</p>

<p>80 column width restrictions bores me.</p>

<p>Optional curly brackets on if/else statements bores me.</p>

<p>Commas between items in arrays bores me.</p>

<p>Whether to use infix or prefix function notation bores me.</p>

<p>Tools that with red text in your terminal tells you how much of a fucking idiot you are for spending a whole 81 columns for a line - they bore me.</p>

<p>Whether to care about spaces after the end of the line bores me.</p>

<h2>But data is awesome!</h2>

<p>What I want in my tool chain is a data editor. Not another mind-numbingly boring text editor.</p>

<p>Data doesn't have formatting. Data doesn't have optional semi colons or commas between items in arrays. Data is just data. Data is what matters. Code is data. Data is code.</p>

<p>A data editor would let me edit the AST of the code, and then write the text to the files in whatever way the text formatting zealots wants me to. I couldn't care less if you want semi colons, so it would be lovely if my data editor could atomate all of that. I could even open a text file containing XML, and my data editor would display it as lisp, because that's what I like. Then I would edit the data, hit save, and my data edtor save sit as XML.</p>

<p>If I ever decide to write a GUI for <a href="https://github.com/augustl/halt">my operating system</a>, I know what the first app will be.</p>

title: Screwing up fixnum

<p>As <a href="http://chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a> <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8984753198261505541">said</a> (somewhere in there): Many languages, such as Java, is made for stupid programmers, Ruby isn't.</p>

<p>He doesn't mean that Java programmers are stupid, he means that unlike Java, Ruby allows stupid people to do stupid things.</p>

<p>Look at what Ruby kindly allows you to do:</p>

<pre><code>puts 10 / 2
# => 5

class Fixnum
  def /(other)
    self + other
  end
end

puts 10 / 2
# => 12
</code></pre>

<p>Undoubtably a very stupid thing to do. Java would have complained, because Java does not let you do stupid things like this. Ruby allows it, though.</p>

<p>This is good. It means Ruby is flexible, and that if you can dream it, you can do it.</p>

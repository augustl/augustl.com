title: Constant lookup and blocks

<pre><code>class HelperHandler
  def foo_exists
    Foo.exists
  end
  
  module Foo
    def self.exists
      puts "Foo does indeed exist"
    end
  end
end


h = HelperHandler.new
h.foo_exists
# => "Foo does indeed exist"
</code></pre>

<p>No surprises here. This, however, is quite surprising:</p>

<pre><code>class HelperHandler
  def initialize(&block)
    instance_eval(&block)
  end
end

HelperHandler.new do
  foo_exists
  # => "Foo does indeed exist"
  Foo.exists
  # => NameError: uninitialized constant Foo
end
</code></pre>

<p>Doing <code>instance_eval</code> is quite common in Ruby libraries. Sinatra, for example, which is what this website is built on, uses it. It evals the block in the context of the instance in question.</p>

<p>Calling the method worked, but referring to the <code>Foo</code> constant is not OK.</p>

<p>That's because Ruby doesn't care about <code>instance_eval</code> when it comes to constants. Constants are looked up in the calling scope. Nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>Unless you want to be evil and use strings.</p>

<pre><code>class HelperHandler
  def initialize(evil)
    eval(evil)
  end
end

HelperHandler.new "Foo.exists"
# => Foo does indeed exist
</code></pre>

title: Recursively doing stuff with hashes

<p>It's assumed that by "recursive", one means that when a value in a hash contains another hash, do X on that hash as well.</p>

<pre><code>class Hash
  def recursively(&block)
    each {|k, v| Hash === v ? v.recursively(&block) : yield(k, v) }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This lets us do the following:</p>

<pre><code>h = {:foo => "bar", :baz => {:srsly => "ye", :oh_hai => {:works => "indeed"}}}
h.recursively {|k, v| v.upcase! }
# => {:foo=>"BAR", :baz=>{:oh_hai=>{:works=>"INDEED"}, :srsly=>"YE"}}
</code></pre>

<p><tt>SystemStackError: stack level too deep</tt> can be produced by having one of the keys refer to the hash in question, though, be careful.</p>

<pre><code>h = {:foo => "bar", :maz => {:hai => "to you"}}
h[:oops] = h
# => {:oops=>{...}, :foo=>"bar", :maz=>{:hai=>"to you"}}

h.recursively {|k, v| v.upcase! }
# => SystemStackError: stack level too deep
</code></pre>

title: It's christmas, and time for failure!

Well, that's it, then. I failed.

I was supposed to publish a blog post every day in December until the 24th.

I haven't blogged since the 18th, so that means I failed to write the 5 final blog posts except this one.

In case you didn't know, I [fail a lot](https://augustl.com/blog/2019/cultivating_my_failures/).

I sort of expected that I'd fail to write 24 blog posts.

But failing is better than not trying.

The [blog post about Linus Torvalds](https://augustl.com/blog/2019/linus_and_linux_happy_accident/) ended up [on the front page of /r/Linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/e6fvj0/linux_exists_only_because_of_a_happy_accident/) and got shared on Twitter a whole lot. I guess many people haven't heard that story before, and it's a pretty cool story!

THe [blog post about the Microsoft Research study after Vista](https://augustl.com/blog/2019/best_bug_predictor_is_organizational_complexity/) generated a gazillion Tweets, around 90k page views, and great discussion on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21823199) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ec9s2o/the_1_bug_predictor_is_not_technical_its/). It even generated some leads towards a path as a professional writer. 

In other words, doors are now open, that weren't open before I started the advent calendar blog project.

And I generated a bunch of other blog posts that didn't necessarily get a whole lot of attention, but that I'm very proud of, and that some people got a lot out of.

I so very almost decided not to start this blogging project, because I sort of knew that I probably wouldn't finish it properly.

So I failed.

But I'm glad I did!

Happy holidays!

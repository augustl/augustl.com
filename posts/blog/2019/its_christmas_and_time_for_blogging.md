title: It's christmas, and time for blogging!

So I thought I'd do, like, a thing!

The most difficult part is what to call it. In Norwegian, we call it a "bloggejulekalender" (yes, we share long words for things with the German language). In English it's... Advent calendar? Christmas calendar?

Anyway. Every day for 24 days starting the 1st of December, I'll publish a blog post!

I started writing these on the 27th of November. Late, as always.

At the time of writing this (29th of November), I have 8 finished blog posts. 9 if I include this post.

Now, you might say that I'm cheating by making this meta-post count as the first post. To that, I say: YOU GO TRY AND WRITE 24 BLOG POSTS IN 29 DAYS!

I sort of thought that maybe at least I should have them all finished before the 1st of December. At least I have a list of 19 more blog posts - 4 more than I need - that I think I would be able to write, based on stuff I already sort of know something about, so I can spend most of the time writing, and not researching.

We'll just have to see, I guess.

Wish me luck!

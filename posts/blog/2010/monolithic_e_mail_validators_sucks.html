title: Monolithic e-mail validators sucks

<pre><code>validates_format_of :email,
  :with => /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$/
  :message => "E-mail is invalid"</code></pre>
 
<p>Great error messages are cornerstones in great applications.</p>

<p>&#8220;E-mail is invalid&#8221; is not a great error message.</p>

<p>Invalid? What&#8217;s invalid about it? What can you do to make it valid?</p>

<p>I think you should be nicer to your users. Stop worrying about compliance with the RFCs, and validate erroneous user input instead.</p>

<pre><code>validates_format_of :email,
  :with => /@/,
  :message => "Needs to contain an @."

validates_format_of :email,
  :with => /\.[^\.]+$/,
  :message => "Has to end with .com, .org, .net, etc."

validates_format_of :email,
  :with => /^.+@/,
  :message => "Must have an address before the @"

validates_format_of :email,
  :with => /^[^@]+@[^@]+$/,
  :message => "Must be of the format 'something@something.xxx'"</code></pre>

<p>Now we&#8217;re talking. By having many small validators instead of one large, you get to pick an error message for each validator. Much better than a global and generic &#8220;not valid&#8221;. Your user gets to know what went wrong, and what he or she can do to fix it.</p>

<p>And you won&#8217;t need a black belt in regular expressions, either.</p>

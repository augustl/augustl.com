title: Dynamic session expiration time in Rails 3

<h2>Update: new syntax</h2>

<pre><code data-lang="ruby">cookies[:thing] = {:value => {:normal => "session stuff"}, :expires => 2.hours.from_now}

# Signed cookies are encrypted with the apps secret_token.
cookies.signed[:login] = {:value => @user.id, :expires => 1.day.from_now}

# These calls are equivalent.
cookies[:foo] = {:value => "bar", :expires => 20.years.from_now}
cookies.permanent[:foo] = "bar"
</code></pre>

<p>Following is the outdated and obsolete original version of this post.</p>

<div class="obsolete">

<p>I created a <a href="http://github.com/augustl/session-persistence">plugin for remember me checkboxes in Rails 3</a>. This post explains how the plugin works.</p>

<h2>Remember me</h2>

<p>Dynamic session expiration is a fancy name for &#8220;Remember me&#8221; checkboxes on login forms. When unchecked, the session resets when the browser is closed. When checked, the session will last for a given time period (30 minutes, 2 weeks, 1 year, whatever), and when the user visits your site, the countdown resets.</p>

<p>This is how you set coookie expiration time in Rails 3:</p>

<pre><code data-lang="ruby">env["rack.session.options"][:expire_after] = 10.minutes</code></pre>

<p>This alone won&#8217;t do, though.</p>

<h2>Cookie limitations</h2>
<p>Setting <code>:expire_after</code> will set the <code>expires</code> attribute on the cookie. This causes the cookie to persist to the given date even when the browser is closed, while a normal cookie without <code>expires</code> will last as long as the browser is open.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s our problem: When we change something in the <code>session</code> of our Rails app, the cookie needs to be updated. This is done by creating a entirely new cookie to replace the old one. The reason this is a problem is, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2076792">as I learned recently</a>, that browsers will only send the raw cookie data to our Rails app, leaving out the meta data such as the <code>expires</code> of the cookie.</p>

<p>In other words, when we change something in our <code>session</code>, we lose track of when the cookie was supposed to expire. There is no way for Rails to know what the original <code>expires</code> was, since the browser doesn&#8217;t send that information to our Rails app.</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>

<p>The simple answer is to use <a href="http://github.com/augustl/session-persistence">my plugin</a>. Here&#8217;s what my plugin does, under the hood.</p>

<p>When we log in, we set the expiration time in our session.</p>

<pre><code data-lang="ruby">def create
  session[:remember_for] = 1.week
  # Perform regular login..
end</code></pre>

<p>In our application controller, we create an after filter that will pass this session variable to our new cookie.</p>

<pre><code data-lang="ruby">after_filter :persist_session
 
def persist_session
  if session[:remember_for]
    env["rack.session.options"][:expire_after] = session[:remember_for]
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>When we want to log out, just have to delete the session key, and the session will return to normal.</p>

<pre><code data-lang="ruby">def destroy
  session.delete(:remember_for)
end</code></pre>

<p>The after filter in the application controller will run before Rails creates the new cookie. This means that out <code>:remember_for</code> from the old cookie will get passed on to the new cookie before it is replaced.</p>

<p>Win!</p>

<h2>Full example, using the plugin</h2>

<pre><code data-lang="ruby">class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    session_expires_after = 1.day if params[:remember_me]
    
    user = User.authenticate(params[:username], params[:password])
    if user
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      # redirect_to ...
    else
      # ...
    end
  end

  def destroy
     session_expires_now # unsets the session key
     session.delete(:user_id)
     # redirect_to ...
  end
end</code></pre>
</div>

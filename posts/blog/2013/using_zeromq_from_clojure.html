title: Using ZeroMQ from Clojure

<p>I'm quite the JVM noob with only 6 months of Clojure experience, and no prior JVM experience. After some hacking and tweaking, I managed to figure out how to use ZeroMQ from Clojure via Leiningen (the build tool). ZeroMQ is a native library that is packaged in a Java API via JNI, so the steps required weren't obvious to me.</p>

<p>These steps are slightly opinionated, but they should be easily modifiable if your opinion differs from mine.</p>

<h2>Step 0: Install ZeroMQ</h2>

<p>Do it! My development box is currently a Mac running OS X, so I used Homebrew. Your package manager of choice probably has a package for ZeroMQ you can use.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Configure and build JZMQ</h2>

<pre>git clone git://github.com/zeromq/jzmq.git
cd jzmq
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME/myproject/jzmq-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
make
make install</pre>

<p>The actual path you specify with --prefix should be to the same folder as where you intend to put your Leiningen project. You'll see why that is in a second.</p>

<p>These steps are also basically copied from the README at <a href="https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq">https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Install the jar you just built into your local maven repo</h2>

<pre>mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.zeromq -DartifactId=jzmq \
-Dversion=2.1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar \
-Dfile=$HOME/myproject/jzmq-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT/share/java/zmq.jar </pre>

<p>Leiningen hates free floating jars, but installing the jar into your local maven repo (typically ~/.m2) fools Leiningen into thinking it isn't actually a free floating jar.</p>

<p>Note that this jar has a relationship to the dynamic libraries you built with the "make" above, so you can't put this jar into a shared repository. The jar is local to your machine.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Set up Leiningen</h2>

<pre>(defproject myproject "1.0.0"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.4.0"]
                 [org.zeromq/jzmq "2.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
  :profiles {:dev {:jvm-opts ["-Djava.library.path=../jzmq-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT/lib"]}}
  ...)</pre>

<p>As you can see, we assume you put JZMQ into the same folder as your leiningen project, by referring to it via "../". This has two benefits:</p>

<p><strong>You don't hardcode the absolute path into your project.clj.</strong> The actual path of a default JZMQ install will differ from system to sytem. Some might have it in /usr/local, some in $HOME/.brew/whatever, and so on. With a relative setup, you don't enforce any specific directory structure other than requiring that zeromq is in the same folder as your Leiningen project.</p>

<p><strong>You get the specific version of JZMQ your project requires.</strong> If you use an absolute path, say /usr/local, you risk getting a different version of JZMQ than you intended, since you might have installed it into /usr/local via a package manager that might or might not install the version you expect it to.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Use it!</h2>

<pre>lein repl
...
user=&gt; (import [org.zeromq ZMQ ZMQ$Context ZMQ$Socket])
org.zeromq.ZMQ$Socket
user=&gt;</pre>

<p>Most Clojure wrappers around Java APIs are just, well, Clojure wrappers, so I prefer to use the Java APIS directly in almost all cases, unless the Clojure wrapper adds some value beyond just wrapping. Java interop is really easy with Clojure though, I recommend trying it out.</p>

title: Asserting unauthenticated actions

<p>Using <code>assert_unauthenticated</code> to test that your <code>before_filter :require_login</code> thingie works.</p>
 
<p>I&#8217;m not a part of the RSpec mob. It&#8217;s simply not appealing to me, good ol&#8217; <code>"test/unit"</code> is my friend. And with these recent updates on the way <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/81">fixtures works in 2.0</a>, mocking is a bit less cool, too.</p>

<p>(I might be wrong about that mocking thought of mine, though, I&#8217;ve never mocked because I didn&#8217;t see the point of mocking, either. No mocking, no RSpec, what kind of person am I?)</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m using <code>"test/unit"</code>, and I wrote a method to assert that action x and y requires login.</p> 
 
<pre><code>def test_should_block_unauthenticated
  assert_unauthenticated :get => [:new, :edit], 
    :post =>  [:create, :update]
end</code></pre>
  
<p>Here&#8217;s the implementation (in the <tt>test_helper.rb</tt>):</p> 
 
 
<pre><code>def assert_unauthenticated(requests = {})
  requests.each do |type, methods|
    methods.each do |method|
      perform_unauthenticated_assert(type, method)
    end
  end
end

def perform_unauthenticated_assert(type, method)
  # Call the method (e.g. perform the request)
  self.send(type, method)

  # Do the assert
  assert_block "Requesting #{method} with #{type} succeeded without login" do
    begin
      assert !@controller.current_user
      assert_redirected_to login_url
    rescue
      false
    end
  end
end</code></pre>
 
<p>Change the assertions inside the <code>assert_block</code> call to whatever you need to assert.</p> 

<p>And yes, please mail any suggestions on how to get rid of all the silly <code>each</code>-ing to augustlilleaas at google mail dot com.</p>

title: CRAPI

<p>A fun comment I found at the <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">Fake Steve Jobs blog</a>.</p>
 
<p>One of the comments to a <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/12/ical-update.html">post about iCal on Fake Steve Jobs</a>. Lol!</p>
 
<blockquote>

  <p>Apple today announced a partnership with rival Microsoft to allow all Windows-based software to run natively on <span class="caps">OSX</span> by incorporating Win32 code. Dubbed the &#8220;Cupertino-Redmond Application Programming Interface&#8221;, or &#8220;CRAPI&#8221;, it is being hailed as the universal answer to everything. &#8220;This is the biggest Apple partnership since the <span class="caps">ROKR</span>&#8221;, proclaimed <span class="caps">CEO</span> Steve Jobs. &#8220;I&#8217;m really looking forward to working with Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="caps">CRAPI</span> programmers&#8221;.</p>
  <p>Steve Ballmer, <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Microsoft, was similarly optimistic. &#8220;The four most important things right now are <span class="caps">CRAPI</span>, CRAPI, <span class="caps">CRAPI</span>, CRAPI. We&#8217;ve already got tons of <span class="caps">CRAPI</span> developers lined up.&#8221; There was no word yet on how much <span class="caps">CRAPI</span> code had already been written, but it is rumored that Microsoft has been selling <span class="caps">CRAPI</span> products for some time.</p>
  <p>Industry analyst Robert X Cringely took credit for correctly predicting this inevitable union in his blog. &#8220;It&#8217;s exactly what I thought it would be, &#8221; he wrote, adding, &#8220;in a few years everything will be <span class="caps">CRAPI</span>, now that <span class="caps">OSX</span> is both a floor wax and a dessert topping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a comment someone else wrote I didn&#8217;t write this. Seems pretty authentic. As in, it&#8217;s actually a comment to that post, not something someone else wrote. Haven&#8217;t been able to find that text elsewhere (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The+four+most+important+things+right+now+are+CRAPI%22">through google</a>).</p>

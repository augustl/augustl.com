title: limedog - open source project manager

<p>Starting my first real open source project. limedog &#8211; a project manager.</p>

<p>It can be found at google code.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/limedog/">http://code.google.com/p/limedog/</a></p>

<p>I really want to achieve this. Yes, there&#8217;s plenty of other project managers around, but they&#8217;re either expensive (which is what I call things that&#8217;s not free), for software projects only (trac, collaboa, redmine, bla bla) or sucks (.project and all those ugly <span class="caps">PHP</span> apps).</p>
 
 <p>I&#8217;m in love with Basecamp, but it&#8217;s not a basecamp clone. This one is a bit less simpler, so if you always though Basecamp was a bit too simple, this will probably be the app for yah. Like, task lists with statuses and update logs, project plans with Gantt-charts and so on.</p>
 
 <p>Don&#8217;t expect this thing to be around next week, though, I&#8217;ll be hacking on this when I feel like hacking on this.</p>
 
 <p>Contact me at august no space or dot lilleaas at google mail dot com if you want more.</p>
 
 <p>(I love the way I&#8217;m writing in a way that makes it look like this blog actually have some readers besides myself.)</p>
